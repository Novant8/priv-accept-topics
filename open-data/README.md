# Open Data

Here, we offer the datasets we used in the paper, as well as the plots and the code for creating the plots.

The datasets include a compact CSV version of `analyze-topics-api.py`'s outputs, and the collection of total, *Allowed* and *Attested* domains encountered.

The code to generate the plots is inside a Python Jupyter notebook. To execute it, you need Python version 3.11.8 or later. The notebook installs the needed dependencies automatically.
