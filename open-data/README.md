Priv-Accept Open Data
=====================

Here, we offer the datasets we used in the paper, as well as the plots and the code for creating the plots.
The datasets can be downloaded using [this link](https://mplanestore.polito.it:5001/sharing/jtyiNwQmC), while the figures are in the `plots` folder.

The code to generate the plots is in Python Jupyter notebooks. To execute them, you need Python3 and the following libraries: `pandas numpy fastplot statsmodels`. You also need to download the datasets (use the link above) in the `data` directory.
